We followed [Satinsky et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039049/) procedures for internal standard addition to allow for calculation of volume-based absolute copy numbers for each gene or transcript type. Briefly, an mRNA standard without poly(A) tails was synthesized by in vitro transcription. The standard was constructed by linearizing a pFN18A Halotag T7 Flexi Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with BamHI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Each was purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The 5’ nucleotide overhangs were removed using Mung Bean Nuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), followed by purification via phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Complete digestion of the vector was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel. The DNA fragment was then transcribed in vitro using the Riboprobe in vitro Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a T7 RNA polymerase to create a 970 nt artificial transcripts. Residual DNA was removed using RQ1 RNase-Free DNase and the RNA was purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA standard was quantified using the [Qubit® RNA HS Assay Kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q32852) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and RNA nucleotide length was confirmed by electrophoresis. A known number of each standard (1.172 x 10^10 copies) was added independently to each lysis tube immediately prior to the addition of the sample filter.
