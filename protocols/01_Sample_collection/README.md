#### Sample Timing and Location

Lake sampling will occur once during the season, preferably during the clear water phase. The location is either Deep Hole (+43° 5' 54.64", -89° 24' 22.43) or University Bay (+43° 4' 58.33", -89° 25' 17.69"). At the sample location, the information in sections A-D should be collected and recorded in the lake sampling datasheets.

#### Water Column Profiles

The field meter (or sonde) must be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer instructions and properly calibrated no longer than 24 hours prior to sampling of the lake. At regular intervals record: (1) dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/l) and percent saturation, (2) pH (S.U) and (3) temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The first reading should be taken at the surface with the probe fully submerged, the second at 1.0 m, and then at 1.0 m intervals. Final readings should correspond with the depth of the bottom samples approximately 20 m. Readings can be collected using a field meter connected to an appropriate length cord. The probe should be adequately weighted such that it falls vertically through the water column. Care should be taken to not submerge the probe into the sediment.

#### Secchi Depth

To measure Secchi depth, remove sunglasses if applicable. Lower the disk into water at a location outside the influence of direct sunlight, such as within the shadow of the boat. Follow Section C for instructions.

#### Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)

Designates the spectral range of solar radiation from 400 to 700 nanometers that photosynthetic organisms are able to use in the process of photosynthesis. Follow Section C for instructions.

#### Water Samples
Refer to Section B to see what should be sampled.
Generally, water samples are taken from 0.5 m from the surface.

#### RNA Samples

Collect the sample water at a depth of 0.5 m. Filtration volume size will depend on the particulate load of the water. Generally 200-300 ml of sample water is required, but up to a liter may be required during clear water phase. Filtering and storing should be performed in less than 5 min to avoid errors resulting from changes in gene expression of the bacterial populations in the lake. Store the second and third filtered water samples for inorganic analyses (Attachment 1).

#### Preservation

Sampled filters should be stored in screw cap tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen in the dark until extraction. Cryobaby labels and cryotubes should be used so that labels and caps do not come off.

Whether on board or in the lab, all apparatus should be clean. Assemble the filtration apparatus by gently resting a sterile 0.22 um pore-diameter nitrocellulose filter on the clean 47 mm filter holder. Assemble a 14-16 size silicone tube in the portable peristaltic pump and attach the filter holder to one extreme of the tube. Attach cheesecloth in the other extreme with duck tape to avoid bigger particles to pass.

Filtration should not exceed ¾ of the pump speed in order to avoid high filtration pressure.

#### Supplement - Sampling Protocol

Initially, depth profile including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity data must be collected at a maximum of 1-meter intervals. A thermocline exists if greater than 1°C change occurs within a depth change of 1 meter or less. Determination of the existence of a thermocline is essential for proper sampling for modeling.

#### Timing

Samples should be taken every 2 hours after sunrise.
Samples must be taken during sunlight for PAR and Secchi transparency.
