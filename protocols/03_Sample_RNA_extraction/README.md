#### Sample digestion and nucleic acid extraction

1.	Smash filters or cut them with scissors in a 2 ml screw-cap tube. For biomass, use about 30 mg per extraction. Keep filters or biomass on ice before proceeding with the lysis step.
2.	Add 400 uL of lysis solution (20 mM NaAc 3M pH 5.2, 1 mM EDTA, SDS 0,5%, all made in DEPC water) to the filters and incubate them at 65 C during 2 min.
3.	Add lysis matrix (From [FastDNA extraction kit](http://www.mpbio.com/product.php?pid=116540600) or similar) to the lysate and 1 mL of [TRIzol®](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15596026).
4.	Bead beat for 1 min at medium speed (3.5).
5.	Centrifuge 5 min at 14000 x g and save supernatant in a new eppendorf tube.
6.	Add 300 uL of chloroform, mix by gentle inversion 20 times, making an emulsion. If mixed more vigorously you can get more RNA, but the sample gets more contaminated with genomic DNA.
7.	Incubate at RT for 3 min.
8.	Centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 15 min at 4 C.

#### On ice

9.	Take aqueous phase, about 800 uL avoiding interphase (organic phase, pink-colored can be used for DNA extraction).
10.	__Precipitation__: divide the 800 uL into two 1.5-eppendorf tubes. Add 1 mL of 100% cold ethanol and 40 uL of NaAc 3M pH 5.2 (2.5 V of EtOH 100% 0.1 V NaAc) to each tube. Mix the tubes by inversion to avoid freezing the sample.
11.	Incubate at -20 for 2 h or at -80 for 15 min. Centrifuge at 12500 RPM for 30 min at 4 C.
12.	__Washing__: after centrifuging, a white pellet may be observed. Wash with 70% cold ethanol. Centrifuge at 12500 RPM for 25 min at 4 C.
13.	Extract as much as solvent as possible and resuspend in 350 uL buffer RW1 (from [QIAGEN RNeasy® Mini kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/sample-technologies/rna/rna-preparation/rneasy-mini-kit#resources))

#### At room temperature

14.	__On-column DNase digestion:__ follow steps as indicated in the [RNeasy® Mini kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/sample-technologies/rna/rna-preparation/rneasy-mini-kit#resources), part 2, “on-column DNase digestion” (steps 1-4).
15.	__RNA cleanup:__ continue with step 4 of “RNA cleanup”, as indicated in the [RNeasy® Mini kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/sample-technologies/rna/rna-preparation/rneasy-mini-kit#resources).
